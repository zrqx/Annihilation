                    <h1>FAQ's</h1>

                    <h6>1. WHAT IS THIS ?</h6>
                    <p>This is An Idea, A Thought, A Campaign and Obviously a Website! to get everyone to watch Christopher Nolan's "Oppenheimer" in the Theaters along with their friends</p>

                    <h6>2. WHERE AND WHEN ?</h6>
                    <p>At INOX, S Mall, Tumkur on 21st July. First Day, First Show</p>

                    <h6>3. HOW DOES THIS WORK EXACTLY ?</h6>
                    <p>Your Friend Invites you by buying your Ticket. You can invite upto 2 friends by buying their tickets.
                        The Chain goes on until everyone stops inviting.
                        It's a classic MLM Trick, but with a better use case!
                    </p>

                    <h6>4. WHY THIS ?</h6>
                    <p>We love Movies and especially, we are fans of Nolan's Movies. His movies transcend Time, Space, Hearts and even the Cosmos.
                        And we regret not having seen them on Big Screens before. For us, it will the first movie of his to experience in theaters and we are excited about it!
                        So, we thought "Let's make it memorable"
                    </p>

                    <h6>5. WHY EXACTLY THIS?</h6>
                    <p>To be honest, we are bored as f, atm. Uncertainty is taking toll, The Void is pulling us in and Friends are detached more than ever.
                        It seems to be a good idea to gather everyone for one hell of a ride!
                    </p>

                    <h6>6. SHOULD I PAY ANYTHING?</h6>
                    <p>No. This is a site to accompany the Idea / Thought. Buy the Movie tickets (for your friends) from BookMyShow or any other service provider</p>

                    <h6>7. SO, ONLY WEBSITE ?</h6>
                    <p>Along with the Site, we have a <a href="https://t.me/ProjectAnnihilation">Telegram Group</a> for Discussions and Announcements. Join to stay posted</p>

                    <h6>8. I HAVE QUESTIONS</h6>
                    <p>Just drop it in the Telegram Group mentioned above. We'll answer it</p>
